    <h1 class="titlep">6 Summer Colour Trends That Always Look Classy and Expensive</h1>
    <h4 class="by">BY Maxine Eggenberger</h4>
    <p class="shortp">Colour is one of the easiest yet most impactful ways to update your look.
         If you're usually found wearing neutral shades (much like I am), opting for a bright
          dress for the next circled date in your social calendar will be just the thing to give
           your aesthetic a shake-up. Similarly, if you're usually found wearing vivid clothing,
            neutralising your wardrobe with an all-white ensemble can be just the thing if you 
            find yourself in need of a change. Such is the power of colour trends,
         and summer is the ideal time to start experimenting. </p><br><br>

    <p class=" shortp lg">From standout shades to something more subtle, 
        scroll on to see the summer colour trends that will still feel relevant
         next year, and the year after that,
         and the year after that. <br><br>
         TOMATO RED <br><br>
         <img src="imgs/summer-colour-trends.jpg" alt="" class="imglong"> <br><br>
         Red isn't always the easiest colour to wear with other tones, 
         but these fashionable types have cracked it—wear it top to toe. <br><br>
         BUTTERMILK YELLOW <br><br>
         <img src="imgs/buttermilkyellow.jpg" alt="" class="imglong"> <br><br>
         If quiet luxury were a colour, it would absolutely be pale yellow. 
         Long before the aesthetic was a thing, however, buttermilk tones have been a mainstay in
          the summer wardrobes of the best-dressed women I follow. <br><br>More wearable day to day than ultra-bright yellow tones, 
          this shade works well with other summer colours on my list, 
          doubling up as a neutral when you need it to. <br><br>
         FRESH WHITE <br><br>
         <img src="imgs/freshwhite.jpg" alt="" class="imglong"> <br><br>
         Okay, so I know I said I wasn't going to talk about black, 
         but white? This is a shade that feels so intrinsic to summer, 
         it would be remiss of me not to mention it.  <br><br>
         Commonly found by way of lightweight materials such as linen 
         or cotton, some of the most cherished pieces in my wardrobe are 
         white and designed for summer, and I can wear them year after
          year without the slightest concern about them looking dated. <br><br>
            CERULEAN BLUE <br><br>
            <img src="imgs/ceruleanblue.jpg" alt="" class="imglong"> <br><br>
            Often it's the colours we find in nature that feel the most timeless,
             and that's certainly the case with blue. I've noticed more and more people 
             wearing this gorgeous cerulean shade over the 
            past few years, and it's easy to see why. <br><br>
            Joyful and chic in equal measure, this is another shade 
            that looks incredible on everyone. <br><br>

            AVOCADO GREEN <br><br>
            <img src="imgs/avocadogreen.jpg" alt="" class="imglong"> <br><br>
            Kelly green—otherwise known as Bottega Veneta green—is a bright,
             grass-green shade that has been enjoying a surge in popularity over 
             the last few seasons. However, more grounded, avocado-type greens make 
             just as much of a 
            statement while, arguably, being less trend-driven. <br><br>
            Although it looks great on its own, this green's powdery undertones mean
             it styles beautifully with colours you might not expect;
             think pink, orange and blue. <br><br>
            SOFT BEIGE <br><br>
            <img src="imgs/softbeige.jpg" alt="" class="imglong"> <br><br>
            Yes, it's versatile, but my favourite beige looks are when the colour
             takes centre stage as opposed to playing second fiddle to more enticing
              colours. Understated but reliable, beige is the colour I reach for when
               I need to look polished in the summer months, and apparently I'm not the only one.
