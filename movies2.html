         cinematic franchise, promising "Avengers-level events."</p> <br>

    <p class=" shortp lg">The producer of the Sonic franchise teases high-stakes events
         for the cinematic universe. The franchise began with Sonic the Hedgehog in 2020.
          This was followed up by Sonic the Hedgehog 2 in 2022. Both movies combine live-action
           with CGI animation as a Ben Schwartz-voiced blue hedgehog Sonic interacts with a world populated by humans. Other members of the Sonic cast include Jim 
        Carrey, James Marsden, Tika Sumpter, and Idris Elba. <br><br>

        Speaking with Paste Magazine, Sonic producer Toby Ascher speaks on the expansion of Sonic’s cinematic universe.
         The producer said that “the idea of expanding [their] characters in [their] world into television” is an enticing
          opportunity to the Sonic team because they can do “character studies” and explore these individuals more. In the upcoming
           Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and beyond, he teases the appearance of “Avengers-level events” in which grandiose tales " have a lot of different characters.”
            Check out the full quote from Ascher below: <br><br>
            WHAT IS NEXT FOR THE SONIC UNIVERSE? <br>

            As it is, the Sonic movies bring in several characters from the 
            popular video games. This includes the titular azure hedgehog, and side 
            characters like Shadow, Dr. Robotnik, and Knuckles. The Sonic movies come after
             decades of the Sonic games and have several different elements that they could bring 
             into the lore. From Ascher’s statement, the Sonic the Hedgehog team will attempt to incorporate
              as much of that lore as they can to create exciting character meetups and action. <br><br>

              After Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic the Hedgehog 3 was announced. 
              This will be the next major theatrical release for the Sonic franchise, with an expected release 
              date of December 20, 2024. As Ascher references, characters from Sonic the Hedgehog will also be moving 
              into the TV realm. This will arrive via the upcoming Paramount+ TV series Knuckles, which hits the platform on April 26.
               Knuckles will have six episodes and feature Elba in the titular role. <br><br>
