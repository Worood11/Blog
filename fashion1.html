    <h1 class="titlep">The 4 Trends French Girls Are Buying Into This Spring</h1>
    <h4 class="by">By Alexandre Marain</h4>

    <p class=" shortp lg">BERMUDA SHORTS <br><br>
        Good news if the pantless trend strikes fear into your heart:
         Bermuda shorts will be big this spring. 
         The masculine effect of knee-length shorts is chic and ever so slightly unconventional.
          Take your pick from tailored, denim, cotton or leather versions. <br><br>

          POLKA DOTS <br><br>
          Time for leopard to slink back off into the jungle: 
          the 1950s-inspired polka-dot print is about to make its presence felt in a big way.
           Polka dots were all over the spring 2024 runways, 
          adorning everything from minidresses to shoes to tights. <br><br>

          BALLET FLATS<br><br>
          Following a revival fueled by It-girls including Hailey Bieber, 
          ballet flats are going nowhere for spring 2024. 
          Expect to see French girls wearing their embellished versions all summer. <br><br>

          RUGBY SHIRTS <br><br>
          Perhaps we have the general hysteria surrounding Jacob Elordiâ€™s
           performance in Saltburn to thank for this one? 
          The striped rugby shirt popped up on the SS24 runways in Paris, 
          and French girls have well and truly taken note.
