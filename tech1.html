    <p class="shortp">ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence chatbot
         capable of having conversations with people and generating unique,
          human-like text responses. By using a large language model (LLM), 
          which is trained on vast amounts of data from the internet, 
          ChatGPT can answer questions, compose essays, 
        offer advice and write code in a fluent and natural way. </p> <br><br>

        <p class=" shortp lg">WHAT IS ChatGPT? <br><br>
            ChatGPT is a generative AI chatbot created by OpenAI. It’s capable of carrying on
             conversations with human users and generating a wide range of text outputs including recipes,
              computer code, essays and personal letters. It can also critique the user’s writing, 
              summarize long documents and translate text from one language to another. 
              The paid version of ChatGPT also offers features like image and voice inputs and
             integrations with other OpenAI services like the image generator DALL-E. <br><br>
             HOW DOES ChatGPT WORK? <br><br>
             ChatGPT is powered by a large language model made up of neural networks trained on
              a massive amount of information from the internet, including Wikipedia
               articles and research papers. This allows ChatGPT to take a sequence of words
                a user gives it, such as a half-completed sentence, and fill in the blanks with 
                the most statistically probable word given the surrounding context — sort of like auto-complete.
                 The process happens iteratively,
              building from words to sentences, to paragraphs, to pages of text. <br><br>In order to sift through terabytes of internet data and transform that into a text response,
               ChatGPT uses a technique called transformer architecture (hence the “T” in its name). <br><br>
        
               The language models used in ChatGPT are specifically optimized for dialogue and were trained using reinforcement 
               learning from human feedback (RLHF). This approach incorporates human feedback into the training process
                so it can better align its outputs with user intent (and carry on with more natural-sounding dialogue).<br><br>
                WHO CREATED ChatGPT? <br><br>
                OpenAI, an AI research company based in San Francisco, 
                created and launched ChatGPT on November 30, 2022. <br><br>
                OpenAI was co-founded in 2015 by billionaire business mogul Elon Musk and former Y Combinator
                 President Sam Altman, along with a handful of other entrepreneurs. 
                 Notable investors include Microsoft and Thrive Capital, as well as Reid Hoffman, 
                Peter Thiel and Jessica Livingston, founding partner of Y Combinator. <br><br>
                Prior to ChatGPT, OpenAI launched several products, including automatic speech recognition software Whisper, and DALL-E,
                 an AI art generator that can produce images based on text prompts. <br><br>
                 Initially, OpenAI was a non-profit focused on developing artificial intelligence “in the way that is more likely to benefit humanity as whole,
                  unconstrained by a need to generate financial return,” according to a statement from 2015.
                  While OpenAI still operates a non-profit arm, it officially became a “capped profit” corporation in 2019.
