    <p class=" shortp lg">DATE IS HARMFUL AND CAUSES OBESITY BECAUSE OF ITS SUGAR! <br><br>

        This is a totally wrong belief because dates contain only 68% sugar, 
        while other carbohydrates are 100% sugar. 
        Dates also help balance sugar level because their fiber prevents the sugar from raising the level of insulin in the bloodstream. <br><br>

        
        Try Goody Spreadable Date on breakfast or eat dates with peanut butter.

        KEEP THE WHITE AND DUMP THE YOLK! <br><br>
        This belief is based on an outdated common concept that egg increases the cholesterol content because of the yolk. Actually, 
        yolk contains a higher number of nutrients as it has 40% of the total protein in the egg and 90% of the calcium, 
        iron and B complex vitamin.
        Try eggs in these delicious recipes: broad bean tagine with eggs, 
        egg boats with mayonnaise and egg bread moulds. Learn how to make the perfect hard-boiled eggs and many more on our website and Goody Kitchen magazines. <br><br>

        WHITE POTATOES ARE PURE CARBOHYDRATES WITH NO NUTRITIONAL VALUE! <br><br>
        Many still believe that white potatoes are pure carbohydrates with no nutritional value. In fact, they contain high levels of dietary fiber that facilitate digestion and provide satiety and a considerable percentage of potassium. 
        Potassium is known to help the heart, blood pressure, muscles, kidneys and nerves. 
        Try the potato in: potato with mayonnaise salad, potato balls baked or mashed potato pie and many more recipes on our website or Goody Kitchen magazines.</p>
