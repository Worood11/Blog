    <h1 class="titlep">How to Meal Prep for Diabetes</h1>
    <h4 class="by">By Toby Amidor</h4>
    <p class="shortp">Meal prep is incredibly popular and can make it easy to eat 
        healthier on a regular basis. However, if you’re diabetic, typical meal prep solutions
         might not work for you. In my latest cookbook Diabetes Create Your Plate Meal Prep Cookbook: 100 Delicious Plate-Method Recipes, I present and explain the Diabetes Plate Method, and how to meal prep 5 different meal plans using a method developed by the American Diabetes Association. Meal plans range in complexity from beginners to experienced meal preppers. Below you’ll find a brief overview of the Diabetes Plate Method and how to
         meal prep for people with diabetes using this method.</p><br>

    <p class=" shortp lg">WHAT IS THE DIABETES PLATE METHOND? <br><br>
        If you have diabetes, this method makes eating simple without any calorie- 
        or carb-counting. Start with a 9-inch dinner plate. (If you need more calories 
        than average, use an 11- or 12-inch dinner plate. For or slightly lower needs, 
        use an 8-inch plate.) For meal prepping, fill a plate and then transfer the amounts into
         a meal prep container. The five steps of the Diabetes Plate Method are as follows: <br><br>
         Step 1. Fill half of your plate with non-starchy vegetables, such as broccoli, 
         cauliflower, spinach or kale. <br><br>
         Step 2. Fill one-quarter of your plate with lean protein
          foods, such as lean meat, fish or seafood, eggs or plant-based protein 
          like beans or tofu. <br><br>
          Step 3. Fill the final quarter of your plate
           with carbohydrate foods, such as grains, starchy vegetables,
            fruit, milk or yogurt. <br><br>
            Step 4. Choose a zero-calorie beverage like water or seltzer. <br><br>
            Step 5. Use healthy fats (like vinaigrette dressings or avocado) in small amounts 
            and add them to your plate. <br><br><br>
            FOOD SAFETY IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT <br><br>
            People with diabetes have a weaker immune system and are more susceptible to foodborne illness.
             That is why it’s so important to follow proper food safety guidelines. Here are five important
              food safety recommendations to follow: <br><br>
              - Storage time: Cooked meals should be store a maximum of four days
               in the refrigerator. If you would like to cook a meal that lasts all 
               five days, then make sure to freeze one container so it can be used later 
               on in the week. To defrost, place the frozen meal prep container in the refrigerator
                the night before. <br><br>
               - Keep your hands clean: Always remember to wash your hands before starting 
               to meal prep and between handling raw foods like meats and ready-to-eat foods 
               like produce. <br><br>
               - Separate foods: Meal prepping has you handling more ingredients than
                just one recipe. That means keeping an eye on raw and ready-to-eat foods.
                 Your best bet is to use separate cutting boards for these items to avoid 
                 cross-contamination. <br><br>
                - Use a thermometer: The most effective way to know if your meat or poultry
                 is cooked through is to use a meat thermometer placed in the thickest part. 
                 Look for recipes that have the cooking temperature listed or use a meat thermometer 
                 with built in cooking temperatures. <br><br>
                 - Properly reheat: When you are ready to eat your frozen meals,
                  transfer the container to the refrigerator the night before to thaw. 
                  Reheat your microwave-safe or oven-safe container in the microwave or oven, 
                  or transfer the contents of the container into a pot or pan and reheat on the stove. <br><br><br>

                  MEAL PREPPING USING THE DIABETES PLATE METHOD <br><br>

                  The next step is to use the Diabetes Plate Method to prep
                   your meals for the week. Below are meal prepping guidelines. <br><br>
                   - Choose when to prep: You can choose to prep for one full day or two half days. <br><br>
                   - Decide which meals to prep: You do not have to prep every single meal for the week. Start slow and build your way up.
                    If you get lunch at work or have several work or social dinners a week, then there is no need to prep dinners for every 
                    single night of the week. Create a weekly meal plan or calendar to determine how many meals you actually need. It can vary from week to week. <br><br>

                    - Find recipes for people with diabetes: You can find meal prep recipes in my cookbook Diabetes Create Your Plate Meal Prep Cookbook and also on 
                    the American Diabetes Association’s website. Make sure the recipes are suitable for people with diabetes. <br><br>
                    - Go food shopping: Review recipes carefully so you don’t buy an expensive ingredient you already have. Write a shopping 
                    list using the flow of the supermarket which helps save trips back and forth for items you forgot. Give yourself about two hours for 
                    the food shopping process. <br><br>
                    - Prep and cook: Once you have your recipes and ingredients, it’s time to start cooking.
                     Do your chopping, slicing and dicing first and then work on recipes that take longer to cook.
                      During the cooking time, prepare easier recipes like dressings or snacks. <br><br>
                    - Portion and pack: This is essential for a person with diabetes to do in order to ensure that you’re getting 
                    a well-balanced meal and not over- or under-eating. Pack your containers immediately after you finish cooking your meal.
